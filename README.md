## Usage

This Employee Database was designed to run on a Node Command Line Interface(CLI). It retrieves information from the user and inputs their data dynamically into a database within MySQL. It's the perfect way to keep track of multiple people within different sections of an organization. It was also designed to meet the criteria for GT Full-stack Flex program homework requirements.

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech, FullStack Flex program. However, I
recieved insight on how to generate an array of manager and role choices, using the .map prototype by my tutor, Kevin Ferguson.
